SIEGE is a simple web-based video game inspired by the popular classic, Space Invaders. The twist is that there is one player on each side of the screen (designed for the CreaTable, one player on each side of the table). The goal is to not die first. 

Lead by Dylan Kobayashi, we worked together to create this game as an educational exercise. All assets are original content. 

To begin, we had an initial "test" to gauge us as programmers. The test was to create two versions of Pong, one with only HTML/Javascript, and one with Konva. 

After that, we started off with a few planning meetings for SIEGE, discussing workflow, features, duties, design, etc. I decided to try my hand at programming the game logic, which includes collision detection, end conditions, score tracking, etc.

I had to work closely with the person working on the entities/objects, since I had to figure out what object functions I could use to pull data from. There were definitely some big miscommunications initially. We learned the importance of thorough documentation the hard way.

In the end, we completed the game with full controller support, and even unique AI behavior. IÊ»m pretty happy with the outcome, since at the time, I had little to no experience with Javascript or HTML. It was a great learning experience on how to use Github (especially collaboratively), the importance of communication, and just general Javascript and HTML.
