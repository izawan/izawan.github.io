summary: My personal Discord bot with a variety of different features.
---

Shootz is a pet project I maintain on the side for my personal Discord server. Written entirely in Javascript, Shootz uses a node.js module called discord.js to interact with the Discord API. It was initially designed for an MMORPG, so it includes features like a boss timer tracker, a boss run planner, daily time-based reminders, a casino and currency system, and ranking lookup. 

The bot also interfaces with a local SQLite database to store data, such as timers, currency, etc. I'm currently planning on widening the scope of it to be a bit more universal, as the niche it filled is no longer needed.

The name comes from the popular Hawai'i slang "shootz!", which basically means "alright", or as a way to say bye.

You can add it to your own Discord server by clicking the image below!
